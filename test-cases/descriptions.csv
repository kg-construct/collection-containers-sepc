RMLTC-CC-0003-NEL,Empty lists are not generated,Tests if empty lists are not generated (expected default behavior).,,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,
RMLTC-CC-0003-NELb,Empty lists are not generated II,Tests if empty lists are not generated (expected default behavior). This test cases uses the predicate rml:allowEmptyListAndContainer.,,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,

RMLTC-CC-0004-SM1,GatherMap in subject map (list),Tests if the use of a gather map in the subject map is supported. This test generates a list.,,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,
RMLTC-CC-0004-SM2,GatherMap in subject map (list),Tests if the use of a gather map in the subject map is supported. This test has no predicate-object maps and no class declarations in the subject map. It still needs to generate triples as the lists consists of at least one cons-pair.,,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,
RMLTC-CC-0004-SM3,GatherMap in subject map (list),Tests if the use of a gather map in the subject map is supported. This test has no predicate-object maps and no class declarations in the subject map. Only one list needs to be generated as the other has no values and we only retain non-empty lists. ,,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,

RMLTC-CC-0004-SM5,GatherMap in subject map (bag),"Tests if the use of a gather map in the subject map is supported. This test has no predicate-object maps and no class declarations in the subject map. It should generate a non-empty bag and an empty bag. The reason being that a container has at least one triple ; it's type (bag, seq, or alt).",,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,

RMLTC-CC-0005-App2,Append values of multiple term maps,"Tests appending of values from multiple term maps in an iteration. In this example, one of the arrays is empty and the expected behavior is to concatinate a list with the empty list.",,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,

RMLTC-CC-0005-Car2,Cartesian product of values from multiple term maps of a gather map.,Tests generating the Cartesian product of values from multiple term maps in a gather map. This test covers the case where one of the sets is empty. The Cartesian product of a set with an empty set is empty. This entry should thus not yield a list.,,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,

RMLTC-CC-0006-IT1,Gather values accross iterations.,"When using a template, constant, or reference for a gather map, this tests determines whether the values are correctly appended to the list. The natural order of the term maps inside the gather map as well as the iteration are respected. This test covers one term map in the gather map.",,JSON,JSON,no,data.json,,,
